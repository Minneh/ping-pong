##Project Site: <https://minneh.github.io/ping-pong.github.io/>

## Created by: Minneh Mugo

# Description:

This web application takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

1. Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "**ping**"
2. Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "**pong**"
3. Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "**pingpong**"

_Example Input: 5_ _Output: 1, 2, ping, 4, pong_

# Specifications:
The program requests numeric input from the user.
The user enters this input which is then stored as the limiting variable.
The program then loops through numbers beginning at one and ending at the user's number, checking at each iteration whether the number is divisible by 3, 5 and/or 15. If the current number is found to be divisible by any of the aforementioned numbers, the corresponding output (as outlined above) is given to the user in list format.
